<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

<div class="content">
  <p>dctech.tv is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.</p>

  <p>This code of conduct applies to all dctech.tv spaces, including our social media profiles, through email, and when interacting with agents of dctech.tv performing recording services, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the sole discretion of Andrew Dunkman.</p>

  <p>Some dctech.tv spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.</p>

  <p>Harassment includes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.</li>
    <li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.</li>
    <li>Deliberate misgendering or use of “dead” or rejected names.</li>
    <li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate.</li>
    <li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “*hug*” or “*backrub*”) without consent or after a request to stop.</li>
    <li>Threats of violence.</li>
    <li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.</li>
    <li>Deliberate intimidation.</li>
    <li>Stalking or following.</li>
    <li>Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes. If you are uncomfortable being recorded by dctech.tv, notify the camera operator as soon as possible so that we can accommodate your preferences.</li>
    <li>Sustained disruption of discussion.</li>
    <li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
    <li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.</li>
    <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.</li>
    <li>Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.</li>
    <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>dctech.tv prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. Andrew Dunkman reserves the right not to act on complaints regarding:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>”Reverse”-isms, including ”reverse racism,” “reverse sexism,” and “cisphobia.”</li>
    <li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”</li>
    <li>Communicating in a “tone” you don’t find congenial.</li>
    <li>Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Reporting</h2>

<div class="content">
  <p>If you are being harassed by a member of dctech.tv, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Andrew Dunkman. He will respond as promptly as he can.</p>

  <p>This code of conduct applies to dctech.tv spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of dctech.tv outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by dctech.tv members seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. Andrew Dunkman reserves the right to exclude people from dctech.tv based on their past behavior, including behavior outside dctech.tv spaces and behavior towards people who are not in dctech.tv.</p>

  <p>In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.</p>

  <p>We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of dctech.tv members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their written, expressed, affirmative consent.</p>
</div>

<h2>Consequences</h2>

<div class="content">
  <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

  <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, Andrew Dunkman may take any action he deems appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all dctech.tv spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other dctech.tv members or the general public, and may ecourage and assist the victims of harassment in contacting law enforcement.</p>
