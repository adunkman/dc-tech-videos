  <div class="row-1 content">
    <p>Hello! I’m <a href="https://github.com/adunkman" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Andrew</a>, a programmer in the DC area. I somehow tricked everyone into believing that I’m a competent public speaker and programmer — it’s probably something to do with my skin color and gender, and that sucks.</p>

    <p>I once saw a conference talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/kronda" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kronda</a> which changed the way I thought about the privilege that I have — I had previously felt quite guilty about my situation, but she implanted the idea of leveraging my privileges to help correct the terribleness.</p>

    <p>There’s a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem with conference speaking sometimes — not everyone wants to take a risk on someone new. I’ve found that after professional recordings of my previous talks were online, conferences were much more comfortable with selecting my talks — and those conferences were more likely to produce professional recordings. So how do you get your first recording online?</p>

    <p>This is where I can help — I’m certainly not the most qualified, but I have a background in technical theater and the resources to give it a try. I could use your help, if you believe in what I am doing — open an issue and tell me your story.</p>

    <p>Don’t believe in my mission? That’s okay, I’ll keep doing me. As my <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-saloon-washington" rel="noopener" target="_blank">favorite non-profit bar</a> says, “Life is good, ya-ya.”</p>

    <p>If you think your conference, meetup, or talk fits our mission and would like it to be recorded, <a href="mailto:support@dctech.tv?subject=Recording%20Request">drop us a line</a> and we’ll be in touch soon.</p>
