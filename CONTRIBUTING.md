Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved, including you!

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing patches and features.

You are required to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in any form of contribution below.

# Using the Issue Tracker

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/adunkman/dctech.tv/issues) is the preferred channel for:

 - [Bug Reports](#bug-reports) and [Feature Requests](#feature-requests) about https://www.dctech.tv.
 - Organizational tasks related to the dctech.tv organization.

Please **do not** use the issue tracker for video recording requests or requests for personal support (see [Video Recording Requests](#video-recording-requests)), or for issues with video captions (see [Reporting Captioning Issues](#reporting-captioning-issues)).

## Bug Reports

A bug is a demonstratable problem that is caused by the code in this repository. Accessibility issues are considered bug reports — thank you for helping!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub Issue Search** to see if the problem has already been reported.
2. **Isolate the problem** by trying to disable browser extensions, trying in different browsers, or trying it on different devices. Include this information when filing an issue to help us fix it faster!
3. **Clearly explain** what you’re expecting to see (or not see) when opening the issue.

Thank you for helping make dctech.tv better!

### Reporting Captioning Issues

To report captioning issues, [send us an email](mailto:support@dctech.tv?subject=Captioning%20Issue) with a link to the video in question, the rough time of the captioning problem, and what you expected to see (or not see).

Thank you for improving the access to information!

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome, but take a moment to consider if your idea fits within the scope of the project defined in the [README](README.md). It’s up to you to make a strong case to convince the project’s developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

Please do not be offended if your idea is not adopted — it is important to keep a project slim and focused to keep it moving forward. Just because an idea isn’t chosen doesn’t mean it’s a bad idea or you are a bad person for suggesting it! Thank you for taking the time to suggesting it!

# Video Recording Requests

If you think your conference, meetup, or talk fits our mission laid out in the [README](README.md) and would like it to be recorded, [send us an email](mailto:support@dctech.tv?subject=Recording%20Request) and we’ll be in touch soon. Do not request a video recording through the issue tracker — it will not be considered unless it is submitted via email.

# Pull Requests

Good pull requests, be it a fix to a bug, an improvement, or a new feature, are very much appreciated. They should remain focused and avoid containing unrelated commits — there is no limit on the number of pull requests that you can submit, so please separate your ideas if you would like them to be considered independently.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request, otherwise you risk spending your time and effort on something which will not be merged into the project. Remember that your code is not you — if your code is rejected, you are not a bad person! Thank you for taking the time to submit a pull request, regardless!

Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout the project. If it is unclear, please ask.

By submitting a pull request, you agree to allow the project owner to license your work under the same license as that used by the project.
